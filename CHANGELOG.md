# Changelog

All notable changes to `protowire-swift` are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

SwiftPM consumers pin against git tags; the version number is kept
aligned with the rest of the `protowire-*` stack — releases bump in
lockstep across language ports when the wire format changes.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0]

Lockstep release with the rest of the `protowire-*` stack at the v1.0.0
spec freeze. Catches the Swift port up from v0.70 to the full v0.72–v1.0
directive grammar (drafts §3.4.2–§3.4.6).

### Added

- **`@<name>` generic directives** (draft §3.4.2): top-of-document
  `@<name> *(<prefix-id>) [{ ... }]` blocks, e.g. chameleon's
  `@header chameleon.v1.LayerHeader { id = "x" }`. Captured on
  `Document.directives` and on `Result.directives` from `unmarshalFull`.
- **`@entry` named directive** (draft §3.4.3): zero/one/two-prefix
  shape, handled by the same generic mechanism.
- **`@dataset <type> ( cols ) row*`** (draft §3.4.4): the protowire-native
  CSV — many instances of one message type in a single document.
  Mutually exclusive with `@type` and top-level field entries.
  Exposed on `Document.datasets` / `Result.datasets`.
- **`@proto`** (draft §3.4.5): embedded protobuf schema with four
  lexically-distinguished body shapes — anonymous `{ ... }`, named
  `<dotted-name> { ... }`, source `""" ... """`, descriptor `b"..."`.
- **`PXF.Schema.isFutureReservedDirective`** (draft §3.4.6): v1 decoders
  reject `@table`, `@datasource`, `@view`, `@procedure`, `@function`,
  `@permissions` so applications cannot squat the names before the spec
  allocates semantics.

### Changed (breaking)

- **`@table` removed**; use `@dataset` (no alias period — same hard
  cutover the rest of the stack made for v1.0).
- **`PXF.Document` extended** with `directives`, `datasets`, `protos`,
  `bodyOffset` fields. Existing consumers of `typeURL` / `entries`
  remain source-compatible.

## [0.70.0]

Initial public release. The version number aligns this port with the rest
of the `protowire-*` stack, which targets the 0.70.x series for the first
coordinated public release.

### Changed (breaking)

- **PXF parser stricter on key forms**, mirroring the upstream grammar
  tightening in
  [`trendvidia/protowire@8262bbb`](https://github.com/trendvidia/protowire/commit/8262bbb)
  (`docs/grammar.ebnf`, `docs/draft-trendvidia-protowire-00.txt`):
  - `=` (field assignment) and `{ … }` (submessage) now require an
    identifier key. Inputs like `123 = 234` or `child { 123 = 123 }`
    are now parse errors with
    `"field assignment with '=' requires an identifier key, got integer
    (\"123\"); use ':' for map entries"`.
  - `:` (map entry) is rejected at document top level — the document
    represents a proto message, never a `map<K,V>`. Use `=` for
    top-level field assignments. Map literals (`field = { 1: "x" }`)
    still work because `:` remains valid inside `{ … }` blocks.

  Three new cases on the `PXF.ParserError` enum carry the new error
  positions and messages:
  `fieldAssignmentRequiresIdentifierKey`,
  `submessageBlockRequiresIdentifierKey`,
  `mapEntryNotAllowedAtTopLevel`.
